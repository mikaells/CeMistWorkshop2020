##Homework 
You need to have a working Linux environment on your PC as well as some background knowledge on how to use it.


1: 
Install a linux shell on your machine. Most bioinformatics is made in Linux, so we install the Ubuntu operating system inside our Windows 10. 
If you have a mac, you can skip this and use your Terminal directly.

2: 
Do a Linux tutorial

3: 
Create a conda environment to run your analysis in. Conda is a package manager that makes sure multiple different programs work together. 
Trying to install software manually is certainly possible, but in my experience takes much longer, and often results in breakage of other software. 

Go to
  https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers

Right click the Linux, 64 bit, python37 link and copy the hyperlink

Download miniconda installer
	wget LINK
with LINK being the link you just got (you can paste by right clicking). This will download the installer 

Run miniconda installer
	bash Miniconda*.sh

Click yes to all 

Make your environment by 
	conda create --name your_env_name 
Your_env_name should be a good name for what you want to do with it. CemistWorkshop might be good
	conda create --name CemistWorkshop

Activate the environment by
	conda activate CemistWorkshop
	
Install a package like this
	conda install PACKAGE

Most packages have a specific install command depending on which server conda should look for it in, usually says on the GitHub for the package
pyani (https://github.com/widdowquinn/pyani) for example installs like this
	conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults pyani
	
All software for the course can be installed by:
  conda install -c bioconda porechop adapterremoval fastqc flye pilon bandage busco prodigal prokka assembly-stats racon filtlong bbmap

#Mac specific (thank you Kresten!):
Generally, terminal does not allow installation of the linux package for miniconda, it's necessary to instead use a MacOS version. 
But don't use the newest version, as this will create issues with the pythin version. Instead install the Miniconda3-py37_4.8.3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh package. 
This will allow installation of flye assembler.
Then, use the following to install busco: 
	conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge  busco=4.1.4    
For Bandage, see https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage/releases/
