# CeMist Workshop 2020
The CeMist Workshop 2020 homepage

19-20th of November, 2020

The workshop this year will have two main themes: Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Multivariate Statistics.

# Day 1 @ Tue Sparholt Jørgensen

The theory and practice behind Nanopore sequencing, assembly and analysis

--timeplan & curriculum goes her


# Day 2 @ Mathies Brinks Sørensen

The theory and application of multivariate statistics with an emphasis on biological data.

The curiculum is devided into two subsections, that of supervised and unsupervised learning. The reading materiale is listed below and can be found in the following books:

Varmuza and P. Filzmoser (2009). Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis in Chemometrics, CRC Press. (VF)
Ron Wehrens (2012). Chemometrics With R: Multivariate Data Analysis in the Natural Sciences and Life Sciences. Springer, Heidelberg. (RW)
The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction. Second Edition, February 2009, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman (ELS)

Each of the books are freely available on DTU findit, note that the ELS book is much more theoretical that the two others but does provide alot more insight on each topic

| Cross-validation (CV) | VF chapter 4.2.5 and 4.2.6| ELS chapter 7 (skip 7.8 and 7.9) |

For a pratical view  of the curiculum, the retired old chemonometric course: https://27411.compute.dtu.dk/Frontpage can be viewed for some help R-code with comments
